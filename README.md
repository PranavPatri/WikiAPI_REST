# WikiAPI_REST
This is an implementation of Node.js REST API for Wikipedia kind of website.

This uses all HTTP methods for fetching, posting, updating, patching and deleting of articles in chaining and uses a NOSQL database such as MongoDB. This is built using `Node.js` and  `Express` framework. I tested this API using <a href='https://www.postman.com/'>**Postman**</a> which works well.
